# MykeTheme for VSCode

My bonkers personal color scheme, based loosely on the [previous Atom version](https://github.com/entozoon/atom-myke-theme-syntax) and the sublime one before that.

## Install

Search for extension, install and reload. Then `ctrl-shift-p` > Preferences: Color Theme > MykeTheme

## NOTE

I first built this with the vscode theme generator but it's garbage. Well, it's not but is rather limited, so boshed out all this boringness by hand.
