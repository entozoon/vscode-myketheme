# MykeTheme for VSCode

My bonkers personal color scheme, based loosely on the [previous Atom version](https://github.com/entozoon/atom-myke-theme-syntax) and the sublime one before that.

## NOTE

I first build this with the vscode theme generator but it's garbage. Well, it's not but it's incredibly limited, so do this boringness by hand.
